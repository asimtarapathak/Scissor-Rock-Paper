# Scissor-Paper-Rock
This is a simple command line Scissor Paper Rock game build in python. 

<b>Modules Used:</b>
<li>-> Colorama</li>
<li>-> win32com.client</li>
<li>-> random</li>
<li>-> time</li>
I have used colorama module to make text and background of the text colorful, I have used win32com.client module to produce the sound "Rock Scissor Paper", I have used random to randomly pic one from the list - Rock, Scissor, Paper and at last i have used time module to delay the printing and speaking sound of Rock, Scissor, Paper.

You can open to use this program and customized it.
